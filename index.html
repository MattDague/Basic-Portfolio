            Well if thats not enough for ya Ill share some behind the scenes details about my life, just for you.
            <br>
            I'm 28 and currently live in Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love. When I'm not helping old ladies cross the street I like to spend my
            free time watching movies, playing games and finding new foods to try. I am also currently learning to cook! Wow, aren't I interesting?
